\label{sec:conclusion}

Through our research, analysis, and testing, we have found what we
consider to be a satisfactory solution. As shown through our proof of
correctness and testing, the algorithm allows for taking a consistent,
point-in-time snapshot as desired from our problem statement. Even in
the presence of out-of-band communication, the algorithm provides
consistency among all of the files even without external dependency
information. Our algorithm is at the level of each individual node,
which means that a Ceph data center with this algorithm remains highly
scalable without increasing impact on the system. Also, with
reasonable guarantees on the uncertainty bounds provided by NTP, the
freeze windows, and as a result the snapshot, should have negligible
impact on a Ceph user. The algorithm is also robust to node failures
since as long as one node in each PG remains up, the snapshot can be
taken and the algorithm can succeed. We have found the NTP to be
satisfactory for the usage in our algorithm in fulfilling the problem
constraints, though We have also outlined alternatives and possible
future work for using and testing other time synchronization
protocols.
