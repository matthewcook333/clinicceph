	abstract = {Raft is a consensus algorithm for managing a replicated log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than Paxos and also provides a better foundation for building practical systems. In order to enhance understandability, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered. Results from a user study demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majorities to guarantee safety.},

	abstract = {There is a gap between the theory and practice of dis-
tributed systems in terms of the use of time. The theory of
distributed systems shunned the notion of time, and intro-
duced “causality tracking” as a clean abstraction to rea-
son about concurrency. The practical systems employed
physical time ({NTP}) information but in a best effort man-
ner due to the difficulty of achieving tight clock synchro-
nization. In an effort to bridge this gap and reconcile the
theory and practice of distributed systems on the topic of
time, we propose a hybrid logical clock, {HLC}, that com-
bines the best of logical clocks and physical clocks. {HLC}
captures the causality relationship like logical clocks, and
enables easy identification of consistent snapshots in dis-
tributed systems. Dually, {HLC} can be used in lieu of phys-
ical/{NTP} clocks since it maintains its logical clock to be
always close to the {NTP} clock. Moreover {HLC} fits in
to 64 bits {NTP} timestamp format, and is masking toler-
ant to {NTP} kinks and uncertainties. We show that {HLC}
has many benefits for wait-free transaction ordering and
performing snapshot reads in multiversion globally dis-
tributed databases.},

	abstract = {Having access to an accurate time is a vital building block in all networks; in wireless sensor networks even more so, because wireless media access or data fusion may depend on it. Starting out with a novel analysis, we show that orthodox clock synchronization algorithms make fundamental mistakes. The state-of-the-art clock synchronization algorithm {FTSP} exhibits an error that grows exponentially with the size of the network, for instance. Since the involved parameters are small, the error only becomes visible in midsize networks of about 10--20 nodes. In contrast, we present {PulseSync}, a new clock synchronization algorithm that is asymptotically optimal. We evaluate {PulseSync} on a Mica2 testbed, and by simulation on larger networks. On a 20 node network, the prototype implementation of {PulseSync} outperforms {FTSP} by a factor of 5. Theory and simulation show that for larger networks, {PulseSync} offers an accuracy which is several orders of magnitude better than {FTSP}. To round off the presentation, we investigate several optimization issues, e.g. media access and local skew.},

	abstract = {Clock synchronization is an enabling service for a wide range of applications and protocols in both wired and wireless networks. We study the implications of clock drift and communication latency on the accuracy of clock synchronization when scaling the network diameter. Starting with a theoretical analysis of synchronization protocols, we prove tight bounds on the synchronization error in a model that assumes independently and randomly distributed communication delays and slowly changing drifts. While this model is more optimistic than traditional worst-case analysis, it much better captures the nature of real-world systems such as wireless networks. The bound on the synchronization accuracy, which is roughly the square root of the network diameter, is achieved by the novel {PulseSync} protocol. Extensive experiments demonstrate that {PulseSync} is able to meet the predictions from theory and tightly synchronizes large networks. This contrasts against an exponential growth of the skew incurred by the state-of-the-art protocol for wireless sensor networks. Moreover, {PulseSync} adapts much faster to network dynamics and changing clock drifts than this protocol.},

Our implementation offers excellent performance, reliability, and scalability while providing clients with the illusion of a single logical object store.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor network applications, similarly to other distributed systems, often require a scalable time synchronization service enabling data consistency and coordination. This paper describes the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol ({FTSP}), especially tailored for applications requiring stringent precision on resource limited wireless platforms. The proposed time synchronization protocol uses low communication bandwidth and it is robust against node and link failures. The {FTSP} achieves its robustness by utilizing periodic flooding of synchronization messages, and implicit dynamic topology update. The unique high precision performance is reached by utilizing {MAC}-layer time-stamping and comprehensive error compensation including clock skew estimation. The sources of delays and uncertainties in message transmission are analyzed in detail and techniques are presented to mitigate their effects. The {FTSP} was implemented on the Berkeley Mica2 platform and evaluated in a 60-node, multi-hop setup. The average per-hop synchronization error was in the one microsecond range, which is markedly better than that of the existing {RBS} and {TPSN} algorithms.},

More importantly, the worst-case clock skew between neighboring nodes is (asymptotically) at most a factor of two larger than the best possible bound. While previous results solely focused on the dependency of the skew bounds on the network diameter, we prove that our techniques are optimal also with respect to the maximum clock drift, the uncertainty in message delays, and the imposed bounds on the clock rates. The presented results all hold in a general model where both the clock drifts and the message delays may vary arbitrarily within pre-specified bounds. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits a number of other highly desirable properties. First, the algorithm ensures that the clock values remain in an affine linear envelope of real time. A better worst-case bound on the accuracy with respect to real time cannot be achieved in the absence of an external timer. Second, the algorithm minimizes the number and size of messages that need to be exchanged in a given time period. Moreover, only a small number of bits must be stored locally for each neighbor. Finally, our algorithm can easily be adapted for a variety of other prominent synchronization models.},
